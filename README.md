# Robust Python Calculator - Lesson 6

This Python program asks the user for a number and calculates:

- Adds 10 to the number
- Multiplies the result by 3
- Converts the result to an integer
- Prints both the multiplied result and the integer result

It is **robust**: handles invalid input without crashing using try/except.

## How to Run

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed
2. Clone or download this repository
3. Run the program:

```bash
python calculator_lesson6.py
